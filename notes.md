   - what is it? physics simulator -- a dream machine. an AGI system
     can use this competency to reason about highly complex domains,
     like the real world. it can consider possible futures if action
     A is taken versus action B i.e., counterfactual reasoning. if it can
     predict it, in some sense it can control it and understand it in
     some way.

   - mention: LLMs with simulator tools

   - the outputs of these tools act as "latent" data for LLMs to in-context
   learn from. They also condition it on more reliable data, which is
   a good thing.

   - RAGs are a good example of this.

   - python interpreter

   - prolog interpreter - GOFAI
